      <description>In his Axis of Evil Comedy tour, Maz Jobrani tells a joke that nicely encapsulates a central problem with American media coverage of Muslims. We use it as an epigraph for the first chapter of our book Covering Muslims. You can watch Maz deliver it here (it starts around 1:25).
We were thrilled to talk about the book with Jobrani and his cohost Tehran for an episode of the podcast &amp;ldquo;Back to School with Maz Jobrani&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Surprisingly, it is a page wholely dedicated to a figure displaying trends over time in the number of articles published mentioning Muslims in four different countries. To read our page 99 test story, click on the image below.</description>
