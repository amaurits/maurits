      <description>First steps     I have long been a fan of static websites, which are portable, compact, and do not require a lot of server overhead. Since it was time to update my woefully inadequate website, I did some research into different static website options.
 Hugo is a powerful and widely-used framework for building static websites and offers a number of attractive themes.
 Blogdown makes it easy to edit a website&amp;rsquo;s files within RStudio.</description>

      <title>Markdown and page formatting</title>

      <description>Basic text formatting     Basic markdown and standard html tags work in most places where text is used in the website, but not everywhere. In particular, some pieces of text do not allow internal modifications to text size. One of the few possibilities there is to use the &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; tags to make text subscript (and therefore also smaller).
Code blocks     Code blocks are started and stopped by triple backquotes.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.      Because Speed     Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>
