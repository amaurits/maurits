      <title>Building a new website</title>

      <description>First steps     I have long been a fan of static websites, which are portable, compact, and do not require a lot of server overhead. Since it was time to update my woefully inadequate website, I did some research into different static website options.
 Hugo is a powerful and widely-used framework for building static websites and offers a number of attractive themes.
 Blogdown makes it easy to edit a website&amp;rsquo;s files within RStudio.</description>

      <title>Markdown and page formatting</title>
      <link>https://maurits-vanderveen.netlify.app/blog/meta-series/02-textformatting/</link>

      <description>Basic text formatting     Basic markdown and standard html tags work in most places where text is used in the website, but not everywhere. In particular, some pieces of text do not allow internal modifications to text size. One of the few possibilities there is to use the &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; tags to make text subscript (and therefore also smaller).
Code blocks     Code blocks are started and stopped by triple backquotes.</description>

      <title>European solidarity</title>

      <description>Solidarity and shared identity in Europe     The long-term viability of European integration relies on a sense that member states and publics share important connections. Whether framed in terms of a European identity, the idea of linked fates, or more prosaically economic interdependence, a feeling that states and publics are connected is essential. Where does such a feeling come from? Does it make sense to think of it as transnational solidarity?</description>

      <title>Idea diffusion</title>

      <description>How do concepts travel?     When Black Lives Matter protests exploded in the summer of 2020, they did so on a global scale. Protests around the world invariably had a dual goal: expressing solidarity with the American BLM movement, and linking that movement&amp;rsquo;s goals to related domestic concerns. I am interested in the international spread of these kinds of political ideas: How are ideas that originate in one context mapped to another situation?</description>

      <title>Systematic text analysis - language, emotions and judgments</title>
      <link>https://maurits-vanderveen.netlify.app/research/text-analysis/</link>

      <description>Software and lexica for automated text analysis     All of the ongoing research projects require an ability to analyze texts: media (both traditional and social), legislative and political debates, party platforms, etc. In particular, I am interested in improving our ability to extract information about the ways an issue is framed from texts, including the emotional and/or moral dimensions of those frames, and across multiple languages.</description>

      <title>Tachyons for Style</title>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.      Because Speed     Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.”     — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1
 Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips.</description>

      <description>Formspree makes it easy to receive submissions from HTML forms on your static website.      Functional Form     This theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used.</description>
