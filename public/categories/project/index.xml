      <description>Migrants and refugees in the public discourse     Migration is a thorny political issue almost everywhere.

My research looks at whether migrants are thought of differently from refugees or victims of cross-border human trafficking; how the nation of origin of migrants affects attitudes, and how competing perceptions of migrants affect both national policy and international diplomacy (especially within Europe) regarding migrants.</description>
