      <description>In his Axis of Evil Comedy tour, Maz Jobrani tells a joke that nicely encapsulates a central problem with American media coverage of Muslims. We use it as an epigraph for the first chapter of our book Covering Muslims. You can watch Maz deliver it here (it starts around 1:25).
We were thrilled to talk about the book with Jobrani and his cohost Tehran for an episode of the podcast &amp;ldquo;Back to School with Maz Jobrani&amp;rdquo;.</description>
