subtitle: Political scientist & computational socials scientist at William & Mary
description: |
  Welcome! 
  
  I am an Associate Professor of Government at William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA. Prior to coming to William & Mary in 2010, I taught at the University of Georgia and the University of Pennsylvania. 
  
  My research investigates the origins and impact of perceptions and beliefs in international relations, with a  focus on beliefs about "others": members of different minorities, (im)migrants, foreigners, etc. As a computational social scientist, I am particularly interested in measuring different aspects of beliefs and attitudes in texts, ranging from legislative debates to newspapers to social media. 
  
  Current projects include measuring emotions and moral judgments in political debates about migrants, analyzing the spread of cultural ideas across borders, and studying the presence and depth of international solidarity within the European Union.
  
  My first book, _Ideas, Interests, and Foreign Aid_ (Cambridge, 2011) identified a broad range of different ideas about the purpose of foreign aid, and showed how these shape the size, distribution, and contents of national foreign aid programs. My second book, with Erik Bleich, _Covering Muslims: American Newspapers in Comparative Perspective_ (Oxford, 2022) examines the tone and content of the media's coverage of Muslims and Islam, showing that it has long been extraordinarily negative compared to the coverage of other ethnic, racial and religious groups, both in the United States and across a range of other countries in the Global North.
  
  I am a serious runner, and used to race marathons regularly.
