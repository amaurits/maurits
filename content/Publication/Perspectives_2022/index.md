excerpt: "A back and forth review-and-response ('Critical Dialogue') between Erik Bleich and myself, as authors of _Covering Muslims_, and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten and Paul M. Sniderman, authors of _The Struggle for Inclusion: Muslim Minorities and the Democratic Ethos_. As we write in response to their review, "Juxtaposing the findings of our two books leads to a host of compelling research questions. We look forward to further research that enriches our understanding of the interactions between media coverage and public attitudes toward Muslims and other marginalized groups."
