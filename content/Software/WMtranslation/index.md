excerpt: "**Embedding-based word-level translation**\n\n

Automated machine translation has come a long way, and neural machine translation (as used e.g. by Google Translate) is now very good. However, translating large quantities of texts for research purposes remains resource intensive. I make available bilingual word-level translation dictionaries that exceed in both size and quality any readily available alternatives. Translation4tru includes these dictionaries, along with python notebooks that can be used to apply them to translate text, as well as notebooks and code that can be used to develop translation dictionaries for additional language pairs.\n\n

Note: this repository is still under active development. In particular, better translation dictionaries will be uploaded by mid-June 2022.
