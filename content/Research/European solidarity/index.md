excerpt: "The long-term viability of European integration relies on a sense that member states and publics
share important connections. Whether framed in terms of a European identity, the idea of linked fates, or
more prosaically economic interdependence, a feeling that states and publics are connected is essential. Where does such a feeling come from? Does it make sense to think of it as transnational solidarity? Is it stronger in some countries than in others? And how do the European Union's limits affect who the connectedness extends to?\n\n
