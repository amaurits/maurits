---

In his Axis of Evil Comedy tour, [Maz Jobrani](https://www.mazjobrani.com/) tells a joke that nicely encapsulates a central problem with American media coverage of Muslims. We use it as an epigraph for the first chapter of our book _Covering Muslims_. You can watch Maz deliver it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=718bxd8ojBY) (it starts around 1:25).

We were thrilled to talk about the book with Jobrani and his cohost [Tehran](https://www.iamtehran.com/) for an episode of the podcast ["Back to School with Maz Jobrani"](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/back-to-school-with-maz-jobrani/id1459194552). We discussed key findings in the book, as well as about broader issues related to the findings, plus whether or not the Netherlands is part of Scandinavia :smiley:.
