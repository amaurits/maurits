---

All social inequalities, by definition, involve one group that has more and another that has less, but do people tend to describe inequalities in terms of advantage or disadvantage? 

I was part of a team investigating this question Using multiple methods and research contexts. We found that journalists and laypersons frequently describe racial and gender inequalities in terms of ethnic minority and female disadvantage, respectively, as opposed to white and male advantage. 

To mark the publication of the findings in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, the William & Mary news team published a story about the research.
