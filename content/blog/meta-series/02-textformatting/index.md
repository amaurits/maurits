## Basic text formatting

Basic markdown and standard html tags work in most places where text is used in the website, but not everywhere. In particular, some pieces of text do not allow internal modifications to text size. One of the few possibilities there is to use the `<sub></sub>` tags to make text subscript (and therefore also smaller).

## Code blocks

Code blocks are started and stopped by triple backquotes. Immediately following the opening backquote, specify the formatting to use for the text in the block (for example: `toml` or `yaml`).
