    The illustrations on this page are all from old books (a hobby of mine). At the top of this sidebar: the 'Secret Resolutions' of the Dutch States-General, a history of Dutch diplomatic relations in the 16th-18th centuries; for the international relations section: the title page of Grotius' Laws of War and Peace; for the comparative/IR section: a cartographic depiction of Europe as a woman, from MÃ¼nster's Cosmographia; for the data science section: a chained binding, from Harvard's Houghton Library; for the final section: the title page of Darwin's Origin of Species."
